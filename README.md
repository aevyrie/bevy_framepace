### Usage

It's as simple as adding the plugin to your app:

```rs
app.add_plugins(bevy_framepace::FramepacePlugin);
```

By default, the plugin will automatically measure your framerate and use this for framepacing.

You can adjust the framerate limit at runtime by modifying the`FramepaceSettings` resource. For
example, to set the framerate limit to 30fps:

```rs
settings.limiter = Limiter::from_framerate(30.0),
```

See `demo.rs` in the examples folder, or run with:

```console
cargo run --release --example demo
```

## How it works

The plugin works by recording how long it takes to render each frame, and sleeping the main thread
until the desired frametime is reached. This ensures the next frame isn't started until the very
last moment, delaying the event loop from restarting. By delaying the event loop, and thus input
collection, this reduces motion-to-photon latency by moving reading input closer to  rendering the
frame.

The `spin_sleep` dependency is needed for precise sleep times. The sleep function in the standard
library is not accurate enough for this application, especially on Windows.

## Bevy Version Support

I intend to track the `main` branch of Bevy. PRs supporting this are welcome!
